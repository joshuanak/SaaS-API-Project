# SaaS-API-Project
Practice creating a full-stack project with a working API that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) data.

Spring Boot Initialized Project utilizing Maven and built with Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! Routing is simple but the route /events.html is an example admin page with access to data. Data can be added via a form, is read from a database, and can be updated or deleted via buttons on the page.
